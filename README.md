# 🛡️ PandemicGuard: AI-Powered Early Detection of Future Global Pandemics

>**“The next epidemic won’t wait for a headline. It will start silently. Our duty is to hear it before the world does.”-PandemicGuard Project
> *PandemicGuard* is a research-grade AI system designed to identify early warning signals of future pandemics using global NLP data streams and time-series health indicators. This project combines public health urgency, artificial intelligence, and ethical foresight into one unified platform.

## 📘 Abstract

**PandemicGuard** is an early-stage pandemic detection system that leverages deep learning (BioBERT NLP models), time-series anomaly forecasting, and public web health signals to predict potential global outbreaks before they escalate. Inspired by the need for faster-than-government alerts, this project explores the intersection of **AI, epidemiology, and ethical governance** in a post-COVID world. Designed with competition-grade integrity and undergraduate research standards, PandemicGuard aspires to be both a tool and a call to action.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Detect early signals of pandemics using real-time data sources (news, social feeds, public records).
- ✅ Apply BioBERT for medical NLP classification of outbreak-related terminology.
- ✅ Forecast outbreak anomalies using LSTM/ARIMA on temporal datasets.
- ✅ Provide a transparent Streamlit dashboard for public and expert interpretation.
- ✅ Package all findings into a research-grade paper and open-source portfolio.
